# HearthDb

HearthDb is a .NET Hearthstone database.

## Cards
`HearthDb.Cards` contains all card information compiled from `CardDefs.xml` and the `CARDS.xml` (the cards DBF file).  

Both files are from the [hs-data HearthSim project](https://github.com/HearthSim/hs-data).

See [here](https://github.com/Epix37/HearthDb/blob/master/HearthDb.Tests/UnitTest1.cs#L14-L25) for example usage.

## CardIDs
`HearthDb.CardIds` contains properly named constant for all cardIds existing in Hearthstone. 

The cardIds file was generated by `HearthDb.CardIdLibGenerator`. 

See [here](https://github.com/Epix37/HearthDb/blob/master/HearthDb.Tests/UnitTest1.cs#L28-L34) for example usage.
